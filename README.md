## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [SASS Pre-Processor](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM Methodology](https://getbem.com/)

### What I learned

While working on this project I reinforced my basic knowledge of React, which I started learning recently.
I learned how to create and use **components** and how to pass values between them using **props**.
I've also used **hooks**, but it's still a concept I'm trying to wrap my head around.

### Continued development

In future projects I'm definitely going to keep on using React to become a fluent user of this framework. I'm also going
to try and use Vite full potential, because for now I only used it as a quick React project starter, but I know that it
can be used for so much more.

### Useful resources
